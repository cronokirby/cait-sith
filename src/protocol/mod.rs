//! This module provides abstractions for working with protocols.
//! 
//! This library tries to abstract away as much of the internal machinery
//! of protocols as much as possible. To use a protocol, you just need to be able
//! to deliver messages to and from that protocol, and eventually it will produce
//! a result, without you having to worry about how many rounds it has, or how
//! to serialize the emssages it produces.
